# JOE A PLATFORMER CHANGE LOG

## 2023-06-09: 1.0.0, The Portal Update
- Added portal lines display. Press P to toggle it. When active, portals will draw a line to their destination.
- Due to limitations with the original game, I can't make it reactive whenever you change the X/Y values when editing portals. Sorry.
- ...But, that doesn't really matter because of the clipboard feature! Select a tile with C+Middle Click, and its position will be copied to the clipboard. The next portal you place will have its destination set to that position.
- Advanced portal info displays the current clipboard position.
- mobile users go to hell
